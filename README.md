## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

So this was my second challange, and honestly I already saw some progress in my code. I learned how to center a container vertically and horizontally on the viewport using:

```css
.body {
  min-height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

And on this challange i tried git using the built in source control of VS Code.
